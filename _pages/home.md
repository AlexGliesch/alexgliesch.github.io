I'm a PhD student at the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)](http://inf.ufrgs.br), under the supervision of prof. [Marcus Ritt](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/). My thesis topic is on exact and heuristic algorithms for districting problems. 

I previously received both my bachelor's and master's degrees from [UFRGS](http://inf.ufrgs.br) under prof. [Marcus Ritt](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/). During my master's I worked on heuristic algorithms for a [fair land allocation problem in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1145/3071178.3071313), and on my bachelor's I developed optimal solutions to the puzzle [Atomix](https://doi.org/10.1109/BRACIS.2016.022).

I'm interested in:
  * solving hard computational problems, both optimally and with heuristics
  * heuristic search for planning
  * combinatorial puzzles and games
  * algorithm implementation in C++

I currently participate in bi-weekly reading groups:
* [planning & search](https://allbits.github.io/planning-search/)
* [automatic algorithm configuration](https://souzamarcelo.github.io/reading-group-aac/)
* [districting](/districting-reading/)
