I'm a Software Developer / Researcher at [Softree Technical Systems](www.softree.com). In my work, I develop optimization and path planning algorithms for road and highway construction. Outside of work, I've recently been interested in learning Rust, and using path planning / heuristic search to solve combinatorial puzzles and games.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://inf.ufrgs.br), Brazil, supervised by prof. [Marcus Ritt](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/). During my Master's and PhD I researched optimization algorithms for districting, a type of graph clustering problem (thesis [here](https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/264005)). My bachelor's thesis was about finding exact solutions to the Atari video game "[Atomix](https://github.com/AlexGliesch/atomix)".
