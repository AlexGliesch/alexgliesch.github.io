I'm a Software Developer / Researcher at [Softree Technical Systems](www.softree.com). In my work, I develop optimization and pathfinding algorithms for road and highway construction using GIS. Outside of work, I've recently been interested in programming in Rust, and solving combinatorial puzzles and games using heuristic search.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://inf.ufrgs.br), Brazil, supervised by prof. [Marcus Ritt](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/). During my master's and [PhD](https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/264005) I developed optimization algorithms for a type of graph clustering problem called districting. My bachelor's thesis was about finding exact solutions to the Atari video game [Atomix](https://github.com/AlexGliesch/atomix) using pathfinding.
