I am a Software Developer / Researcher at [Softree](www.softree.com), where I design optimization and planning algorithms to support decision making in road and highway construction.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://inf.ufrgs.br) in Porto Alegre, Brazil, supervised by prof. [Marcus Ritt](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/). My research focused on optimization algorithms for districting, a type of graph clustering problem. Besides this, I have also worked on problems related to graph coloring, land subdivision, and puzzle solving through path planning.

I am interested in:
  * designing heuristics to computational problems with real-world applicability
  * problems defined over geometric search spaces
  * domain-dependent path planning
  * combinatorial puzzles and games
