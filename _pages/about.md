I'm a Software Developer / Researcher at [Softree](www.softree.com). I design optimization algorithms to support road and highway construction.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science (Algorithms and Optimization) from [INF/UFRGS](http://inf.ufrgs.br), under prof. [Marcus Ritt](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/). My thesis was on heuristic algorithms for districting problems, a type of graph clustering problem. 

<!-- Previously, during my master's I worked on heuristic algorithms for a [fair land allocation problem in Brazil](https://doi.org/10.1145/3071178.3071313), and for my bachelor's I developed optimal solutions to the puzzle [Atomix](https://doi.org/10.1109/BRACIS.2016.022). -->

I'm interested in:
  * solving hard computational problems, both optimally and with heuristics
  * domain-dependent path planning problems
  * problems defined over geometric search spaces
  * combinatorial puzzles and games
